# Tasks: Documentation & HUD Refresh

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/038-docs-hud-refresh/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Primary files**: `README.md`, `ui/netclaw-visual/README.md`, `workspace/SOUL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Source of truth**: `config/openclaw.json`, `workspace/skills/`

## Phase 1: User Story 1 - Accurate Skill Count Display (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Update all skill and MCP server counts in README.md to reflect verified values (179 skills, 43 MCP servers)

**Independent Test**: Run `find workspace/skills -maxdepth 1 -type d | tail -n +2 | wc -l` and compare against counts in README. Run `jq '.mcpServers | keys | length' config/openclaw.json` and compare against README.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T001 [US1] Update header paragraph skill count (113→179) and MCP count (67→43) in README.md line 7
- [x] T002 [US1] Update installer description skill count (113→179) and MCP count (67→43) in README.md line 19
- [x] T003 [US1] Search README.md for any remaining "113 skills" references and update to "179 skills"
- [x] T004 [US1] Search README.md for any remaining "67 MCP" references and update to "43 MCP servers"
- [x] T005 [US1] Verify no outdated counts remain in README.md by searching for "113", "67 MCP", "48 integrations", "103 skills"

**Checkpoint**: README.md now displays accurate skill and MCP server counts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (US1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately (P1 MVP)
- **Phase 2 (US2)**: No dependencies - can start in parallel with Phase 1 (P1)
- **Phase 3 (US3)**: Best after Phase 2 completion (references integration descriptions)
- **Phase 4 (US4)**: Can start in parallel with Phase 1/2 (different files)
- **Phase 5 (US5)**: Can start in parallel (different file)
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies - README count updates
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: No dependencies - README integration descriptions
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Best after US2 (reviews same sections)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: No dependencies - Visual HUD updates (different file)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: No dependencies - SOUL.md updates (different file)

### Parallel Opportunities

Tasks can be parallelized when working on different files:

**Parallel Group A** (README.md focus - serialize within group):
- T001-T005 (US1: counts)
- T006-T015 (US2: integrations)
- T016-T020 (US3: descriptions)

**Parallel Group B** (ui/netclaw-visual/README.md):
- T021-T025 (US4: HUD docs)

**Parallel Group C** (workspace/SOUL.md):
- T026-T029 (US5: SOUL files)

---

## Parallel Example: Initial Phase

```bash
# These can run in parallel (different files):
Task T001-T005: Update README.md counts (US1)
Task T021-T025: Update ui/netclaw-visual/README.md (US4)
Task T026-T029: Update workspace/SOUL.md (US5)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: US1 - Fix skill/MCP counts in README.md
2. Complete Phase 2: US2 - Add missing integration descriptions
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify counts match codebase
4. This delivers the most critical fixes

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete US1 + US2 → Core README accuracy restored
2. Complete US3 → Feature descriptions updated
3. Complete US4 → Visual HUD aligned
4. Complete US5 → SOUL files current
5. Complete Polish → All verification passed, ready for PR

### Parallel Strategy

With parallel execution:
1. Start US1 (README counts), US4 (HUD), US5 (SOUL) simultaneously
2. Continue US2 (README integrations) after US1 count updates
3. Continue US3 (README descriptions) after US2 integration additions
4. Final verification when all complete

---

## Notes

- All tasks are documentation-only (no code changes)
- Verify counts against codebase before finalizing
- Use `find` and `jq` commands to validate accuracy
- Commit after each logical group of changes
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently

--- abstract

This document specifies the NetClaw-to-NetClaw Federation Protocol (NCFED), an
application-layer protocol that lets independently operated AI network-engineering
agents ("NetClaws") discover one another's capabilities, invoke remote tools, and
delegate tasks over long-lived TCP sessions. NCFED multiplexes its federation
channel with BGP-4 and an associated tunneling data plane on a single listening
port, using first-octet protocol discrimination. Its payload is JSON-RPC 2.0
carrying Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) operations. Two trust
models are defined: mutual operator consent for external federation between
different trust domains (eN2N), and enrollment-token bootstrap with
trust-on-first-use (TOFU) key pinning for hub-and-spoke federation within a single
operator's trust domain (iN2N). NCFED does not replace MCP or A2A; it is a
cross-operator federation, identity, and transport layer that carries them. This
document describes the protocol as implemented in the open-source NetClaw project
and is published as Experimental to enable interoperability and public review.

# Introduction

Large-language-model agents that operate network infrastructure are increasingly
deployed as long-running services with tool access to routers, controllers, and
network sources of truth. When two such agents are operated by different parties,
there is value in letting them cooperate: one agent may hold capabilities, data, or
vantage points the other lacks. When one operator runs many narrowly scoped agents,
there is equal value in coordinating them behind a single point of contact.

NCFED addresses both cases with one wire protocol. It provides:

1. First-octet protocol discrimination so that NCFED, BGP-4 {{RFC4271}}, and an
   associated data-plane tunnel (NCTUN, out of scope here) can share a single TCP
   listening port ({{discrimination}}).

2. A compact federation handshake that identifies each peer by an Autonomous System
   number and a router identifier, reusing operational identities already familiar
   from BGP deployments ({{handshake}}).

3. A minimal length-prefixed message framing with a continuation flag and a
   zero-length-frame heartbeat ({{framing}}, {{heartbeat}}).

4. A semantic layer in which capability inventory, remote tool calls (MCP {{MCP}}),
   and task delegation (A2A {{A2A}}) are expressed as JSON-RPC 2.0 {{JSONRPC}}
   messages ({{semantics}}).

5. In-band version and capability negotiation ({{negotiation}}).

6. Two trust-establishment models ({{trust}}): mutual operator consent (eN2N) and
   enrollment-token + TOFU pinning (iN2N).

NCFED is complementary to, not competing with, MCP and A2A: it is the
cross-operator federation/identity/transport layer that carries their payloads.

## Motivation and Applicability {#applicability}

The motivating deployment is a small mesh of independently operated NetClaws. Three
operators each run a lab and automation stack; their agents are already BGP-mesh
peered and can see one another, but could not, before NCFED, discover or use one
another's capabilities. Separately, a single operator may decompose one monolithic
agent (carrying on the order of a hundred skills) into a **risk**: a group of
narrowly focused member agents fronted by a single Border agent that routes requests
to them. (The Border is one member of the risk, not the risk itself.)

NCFED assumes **long-lived sessions between a small number of mutually known
peers**, established deliberately by their operators. It is **not** designed for
anonymous, open, or large-scale federation, and it does not attempt spam
resistance, discovery of unknown peers, or public-key infrastructure. These
assumptions shape the trust models ({{trust}}) and the Security Considerations
({{seccons}}), and are the reason the current design accepts an underlay-dependent
trust model rather than defining its own cryptographic peer authentication (see
{{seccons-peer-auth}} for the intended evolution).

## Status of this Protocol Description

This is an individual submission, published as **Experimental**. The author seeks
adoption of this work by an IETF Working Group addressing agent-to-agent and
agent-to-tool communication (e.g., the effort emerging from the `agentproto` Birds-
of-a-Feather), with the goal of a future Standards-Track document. This `-00`
asserts no IETF consensus. The technical content is category-neutral and may be
re-targeted without change if adopted.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used:

NetClaw (or "claw"):
: A long-running AI agent process that exposes network-engineering capabilities as
  tools.

Risk:
: A named group of claws under a single operator's administrative control,
  coordinated by a Border. ("A risk" is the collective noun for lobsters, the
  project mascot.)

Border:
: The single claw in a risk that terminates external communication, routes requests
  to members, and holds the risk's external identity.

Member:
: A narrowly scoped claw within a risk that dials outbound to its Border and accepts
  delegated work only over that channel.

eN2N (external federation):
: Federation between claws in different trust domains (different operators),
  established by mutual consent.

iN2N (internal federation):
: Federation between a Border and its members within one trust domain, established
  by an enrollment token and TOFU key pinning.

Peer AS / Router-ID:
: The 4-octet Autonomous System number and 4-octet router identifier presented in
  the NCFED handshake. They MAY coincide with BGP identifiers but are not required
  to; they are assigned by operator convention.

{: #fig-stack title="NCFED protocol stack"}

iN2N ({{trust-in2n}}) reuses the same framing and JSON-RPC layers over a separate,
member-initiated transport with its own preamble instead of the shared-port
discrimination.

# Protocol Discrimination {#discrimination}

An NCFED node listens on a single configured TCP port. (In the reference deployment
this is the operator's BGP/mesh port; NCFED defines no fixed well-known port — see
{{iana}}.) The peer that opened the TCP connection is the **initiator** and MUST send
its protocol preamble (the 0xFF BGP marker, or the 5-octet 'N' magic of
{{handshake}}) immediately upon connection establishment; the peer that accepted the
connection is the **acceptor** and reads it. On accepting a connection, the acceptor
reads the first octet. It MUST close the connection if the first octet is not
received within 30 seconds.

* If the first octet is 0xFF, the connection is a BGP-4 session and is handed to the
  BGP engine. (A BGP message header begins with a 16-octet marker of all ones
  {{RFC4271}}.) An implementation that consumes the first octet in order to
  discriminate MUST make it available to the BGP engine again (for example, by
  re-prepending it to the byte stream), because a BGP parser expects to read the
  16-octet marker from the first octet of the stream. The reference implementation
  reads one octet and, for a BGP connection, replays it ahead of the remainder of
  the stream before handing the session to its BGP engine.

* If the first octet is 0x4E ('N'), the node reads the following 4 octets. It MUST
  close the connection if those 4 octets are not received within 10 seconds. The
  resulting 5-octet magic selects the protocol:

  * "NCFED" (0x4E 0x43 0x46 0x45 0x44): the connection proceeds as an NCFED
    federation channel ({{handshake}}).

  * "NCTUN" (0x4E 0x43 0x54 0x55 0x4E): the connection proceeds as an NCTUN
    data-plane channel. NCTUN is out of scope for this document.

  * Any other 5-octet value: the node MUST close the connection.

* Any other first octet: the node MUST close the connection without a response.

This first-octet discrimination is deliberately simpler than, and distinct from,
TLS ALPN {{RFC7301}}, which negotiates at the TLS layer; NCFED discriminates in
cleartext at the start of the TCP byte stream. It follows that NCFED does **not**
perform a TLS handshake on the shared port: the first octet of a TLS ClientHello
record is 0x16 (the TLS "handshake" content type), which is not a recognized
discriminator value, so a direct TLS connection to the shared port is closed like
any other unrecognized preamble. Where an encrypted transport is required, it is
supplied by an underlay or tunnel beneath TCP, or by the separate iN2N listener
({{trust-in2n}}), not by inline TLS on the discrimination port; see {{seccons-conf}}.
{{seccons}} discusses the security consequences of sharing a port with BGP.

# Federation Handshake {#handshake}

Immediately after the "NCFED" magic, the initiating peer sends 8 further octets: a
4-octet Autonomous System number followed by a 4-octet router identifier (a packed
IPv4 address). With the magic, the complete handshake is 13 octets, as shown in
{{fig-handshake}}.

~~~
{: #fig-handshake title="NCFED federation handshake (13 octets)"}

The Autonomous System number is an unsigned 32-bit integer in network byte order
(big-endian). The router identifier is a 4-octet packed IPv4 address. All
multi-octet fields in NCFED are network byte order.

The initiator (the peer that opened the connection; see {{discrimination}}) sends its
13-octet handshake immediately. If the acceptor admits the connection, it replies with
its own 13-octet handshake: the "NCFED" magic followed by the acceptor's AS and
router-id. The initiator MUST verify that the reply begins with the "NCFED" magic and
that the AS/router-id identify the peer it expected, and MUST close the connection
otherwise. The handshake is therefore a request/reply exchange in which each side
presents its claimed identity to the other at the binary layer. Mutual capability
exchange and the remainder of session establishment then proceed at the JSON-RPC
layer via `n2n/hello` ({{semantics}}, {{negotiation}}), which the initiator sends
first. The peer identity used throughout this document is the string
`as<AS>-<router-id>` (for example, `as65001-4.4.4.4`).

To avoid a simultaneous-open ambiguity (both peers dialing at once), NCFED designates
a deterministic initiator: of any two peers, the one with the numerically **lower** AS
number opens the channel, and the peer with the higher or equal AS number only
accepts. An explicit re-dial replaces any existing channel to the same peer identity.

The claimed AS/router-id in the handshake is **not** cryptographically authenticated.
Its trust properties, and the intended evolution toward cryptographic peer
authentication, are described in {{seccons-peer-auth}}.

There is no version octet in the handshake; versioning is negotiated in-band
({{negotiation}}). Appending a version octet immediately after the magic is **not** a
safe way to signal a future incompatible change, because that octet position is
currently the most significant octet of the AS number and cannot be repurposed
without ambiguity for already-deployed peers. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that any
future incompatible change be negotiated in-band ({{negotiation}}), or be introduced
only in a form that a legacy peer rejects cleanly rather than misparses.

# Message Framing {#framing}

After a successful handshake, all traffic on the channel consists of frames, shown
in {{fig-frame}}.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~
{: #fig-frame title="NCFED frame"}

Length:
: Unsigned 32-bit integer, network byte order, counting the payload octets only.
  A payload MUST NOT exceed 65536 octets (64 KiB). A larger message MUST be split
  across multiple frames using the CONTINUATION flag. A receiver that reads a Length
  greater than 65536 MUST close the connection.

Flags:
: One octet. Bit 0 (0x01), CONTINUATION: when set, the payload is a fragment of a
  larger message and MUST be concatenated with the payloads of subsequent frames
  until a frame is received with CONTINUATION clear. Bits 1 through 7 are RESERVED;
  a sender MUST set them to 0 and a receiver MUST ignore them.

Frames carry no message identifier. Consequently, an endpoint MUST NOT interleave the
frames of different messages: once it sends a frame with CONTINUATION set, every
subsequent frame it sends on that channel MUST be a fragment of the same message
until a frame with CONTINUATION clear terminates the message. Fragments MUST be
transmitted contiguously. A frame with Length 0 and CONTINUATION set is a legal empty
fragment that contributes no octets to reassembly. Because a heartbeat ({{heartbeat}})
is a Length-0, CONTINUATION-clear frame, and because reassembly is never in progress
between messages, a heartbeat is sent only between complete messages, never between a
message's fragments; an endpoint MUST NOT emit a heartbeat while a message it is
sending is partially transmitted. A receiver that observes a Length-0,
CONTINUATION-clear frame while a reassembly is in progress SHOULD treat it as a
protocol error and close the channel.

A reassembled message is a complete JSON-RPC 2.0 message ({{semantics}}). Receivers
SHOULD bound both the total size of a reassembled message and the memory held for
in-progress reassembly, and close a channel that exceeds the bound; see
{{seccons-dos}}. This document does not define a specific aggregate bound; the
reference implementation does not currently enforce one (see {{impl-status}}).

# Heartbeat and Liveness {#heartbeat}

A frame with Length 0 and CONTINUATION clear, received when no reassembly is in
progress, is a heartbeat. A heartbeat carries no payload and MUST NOT be delivered to
the application layer; it is sent only between complete messages ({{framing}}).

An endpoint SHOULD send a heartbeat frame approximately every 30 seconds (the
heartbeat interval). Any inbound frame, including a heartbeat, is evidence of liveness
and resets the endpoint's missed-interval count for that channel. An endpoint that
receives no inbound frame for 3 consecutive intervals (approximately 90 seconds) MUST
consider the channel dead and close it. These values mirror the BGP keepalive (30 s)
and hold time (90 s) defaults {{RFC4271}}. On close, an endpoint that initiated the
session SHOULD attempt to re-establish it with bounded backoff.

# Semantic Payload {#semantics}

Reassembled payloads are UTF-8 JSON-RPC 2.0 {{JSONRPC}} messages ({{RFC8259}}). A
message carrying a `method` member is a request (if it also carries `id`) or a
notification (if it does not); a message carrying only `id` with `result` or `error`
is a response. Each request carries a unique `id` chosen by the sender, which the
response echoes. Batch requests (JSON-RPC arrays) are not used: an endpoint sends a
single JSON-RPC object per reassembled message. A reassembled message that is not
well-formed UTF-8 JSON is discarded and SHOULD be logged; its receipt does not by
itself require closing the channel. The concrete parameter and result objects for
each method are specified in {{method-ref}}.

Before federation (eN2N) or trust establishment (iN2N) completes, an endpoint MUST
reject any method other than the handshake method (`n2n/hello` for eN2N;
`in2n/hello` or `in2n/enroll` for iN2N) with the appropriate error ({{errors}}). On an
eN2N channel the initiator sends `n2n/hello` first.

## Method families

n2n/hello:
: Mutual identity plus the capability descriptor ({{negotiation}}). The only method
  permitted before eN2N federation is established.

n2n/inventory, n2n/inventory_get:
: Push and pull of the capability card ({{cards}}).

n2n/tools/call:
: MCP-style {{MCP}} invocation of a named remote tool with JSON arguments, subject
  to the callee's per-peer authorization policy.

n2n/tasks/submit, n2n/tasks/status, n2n/tasks/result, n2n/tasks/cancel:
: A2A-style {{A2A}} asynchronous task delegation and retrieval.

Additional methods (e.g., claw-to-claw chat) MAY be present; unknown methods are
rejected with METHOD_NOT_FOUND ({{errors}}).

## Asynchronous task delegation

A delegated task progresses through the states:

~~~
submitted --> working --> completed
                     \--> failed
                     \--> cancelled
~~~

The callee returns an opaque task identifier from `n2n/tasks/submit`; the caller
retrieves progress and the terminal result via `n2n/tasks/status` and
`n2n/tasks/result`, and MAY request cancellation via `n2n/tasks/cancel`. Task state
persists across channel drops so that results survive reconnection. In the reference
implementation these retrieval methods are keyed by the task identifier alone and do
not verify that the caller is the peer that submitted the task; the task identifier
therefore functions as a bearer capability and MUST be treated as a secret (see
{{seccons-deleg}}). This document does not define a retention or garbage-collection
policy for terminal task state, nor idempotency or retry semantics for resubmission.

## Error codes {#errors}

NCFED uses JSON-RPC error objects. All NCFED application error codes fall within the
JSON-RPC implementation-defined server-error range (-32000 to -32099) {{JSONRPC}};
this reuse is intentional and permitted. The following application error codes are
defined for eN2N:

| Code   | Name              |
|--------|-------------------|
| -32001 | NOT_ALLOWLISTED   |
| -32002 | APPROVAL_PENDING  |
| -32003 | APPROVAL_EXPIRED  |
| -32004 | BUDGET_EXHAUSTED  |
| -32005 | RATE_LIMITED      |
| -32006 | EXECUTION_TIMEOUT |
| -32007 | SEVERED           |
| -32008 | GUARDRAIL_BLOCKED |
| -32010 | NOT_FEDERATED     |
| -32601 | METHOD_NOT_FOUND (JSON-RPC standard) |
{: title="eN2N error codes"}

The following application error codes are defined for iN2N ({{trust-in2n}}):

| Code   | Name                  |
|--------|-----------------------|
| -32021 | ENROLL_TOKEN_INVALID  |
| -32022 | MEMBER_ID_TAKEN       |
| -32023 | MEMBER_NOT_TRUSTED    |
| -32024 | NOT_A_BORDER          |
| -32030 | NO_CAPABLE_MEMBER     |
| -32031 | OUT_OF_SCOPE          |
{: title="iN2N error codes"}

MEMBER_ID_TAKEN (-32022) is reserved for an enrollment whose member identifier is
already pinned to a different key. In the reference implementation this condition is
currently reported as ENROLL_TOKEN_INVALID (-32021), and -32022 is not yet emitted on
the wire (see {{impl-status}}). A key-possession failure at `in2n/hello` or
`in2n/enroll` is reported as MEMBER_NOT_TRUSTED (-32023).

# Version and Capability Negotiation {#negotiation}

NCFED features are advertised in-band at `n2n/hello`, not in the binary handshake.
Each endpoint advertises a capability descriptor:

~~~
{ "proto_version": "053",
  "features": ["async_tasks", "endpoint_reannounce", "negotiate"],
  "agent_invoke": "session-id",
  "reply_shapes": ["finalAssistantVisibleText", "payloads"] }
~~~

`proto_version` is an opaque label identifying a baseline (for example "052" or
"053"); NCFED performs no ordering comparison on it, and an endpoint does not infer
capability from its value. Capability is instead determined field by field: use of an
optional feature is gated solely by its presence in the peer's `features` array, and
the other descriptor fields (for example `agent_invoke` and `reply_shapes`) let each
side adapt to the other's build. An endpoint that receives no descriptor treats the
peer as the baseline "052" with an empty feature set. This mechanism is therefore
feature advertisement with graceful degradation, not selection of a single common
version: an unrecognized feature name is simply not used, and no failure is defined
for a feature one side requires but the other lacks.

Because the binary handshake carries no version indicator, an incompatible change
cannot be signaled below the JSON-RPC layer, and — as noted in {{handshake}} — a
version octet cannot simply be appended to the handshake. It is RECOMMENDED that any
future incompatible change be negotiated in-band through this mechanism. A true
version-negotiation scheme — selecting a common protocol version and defining
behavior when one side requires a feature the other does not support — is left to a
future revision (see {{impl-status}}).

# Capability Cards {#cards}

An endpoint advertises its capabilities in a card exchanged via `n2n/inventory` /
`n2n/inventory_get`. A card contains:

* `skills` and `mcp_servers`: the capabilities the endpoint is willing to expose to
  this peer, after applying the per-peer visibility/authorization policy (not the
  endpoint's full local set);
* `badges`: coarse capability tags;
* `posture`: the advertiser's operational security posture, as
  `{ "mode", "state", "controls" }` (e.g., mode `production`, state `enforced`, and
  the set of active controls);
* `llm`: the advertiser's reasoning-model capability, as
  `{ "primary_model", "guarded" }` — the model family/tier and whether its
  input/output is routed through a guardrail.

A card MUST NOT contain secrets, credentials, or per-member topology of a risk. A
Border advertises its own reasoning model and MAY note that members run their own
tiered models, without revealing individual members.

Even so, because a card enumerates skills, MCP servers, security posture, and
reasoning-model family, it discloses metadata about the advertiser's attack surface.
An endpoint MUST advertise only the subset a given peer is authorized to see, and
operators SHOULD treat card contents as sensitive — particularly while transport is
cleartext ({{seccons-conf}}). A future revision may define a minimized or
integrity-protected card ({{seccons-priv}}).

# Trust Establishment {#trust}

## External federation: eN2N {#trust-en2n}

Peers in different trust domains federate only after explicit mutual operator
consent. The AS/router-id identity of each peer is confirmed **out of band** (for
example, by the operators exchanging it directly) before consent is granted. Consent
is durable and survives restarts and endpoint (e.g., tunnel address) changes; it is
keyed by the peer identity, not by a network address.

A peer's federation state is derived from two independent consent bits — the local
operator's grant and the remote peer's grant — as shown in {{fig-consent}}.
Federation requires both. Which "pending" state a peer occupies depends only on which
grant has been recorded so far, not on a fixed order.

{: #fig-consent title="eN2N consent state, derived from the local and remote grants"}

Only `n2n/hello` is accepted before `federated`. Remote tool invocation is
default-deny: a tool call is rejected (NOT_ALLOWLISTED) unless a per-peer grant
authorizes it, and grants MAY carry approval requirements, budgets, and rate limits
(reflected in the error codes of {{errors}}). Severing revokes the local grant and
drops the channel (the operator kill switch); re-consent restores the local grant,
returning the peer to `not_federated`, from which it may re-federate. As noted in
{{handshake}}, the numerically lower AS initiates the channel.

The claimed AS/router-id is not cryptographically authenticated ({{seccons-peer-auth}});
the out-of-band identity confirmation above is an administrative step, not a runtime
cryptographic proof.

## Internal federation: iN2N {#trust-in2n}

Within a single operator's risk, a member is authenticated by proving possession of
a self-signed key that the Border pinned at enrollment (TOFU), not by BGP identity
or mutual consent. iN2N is hub-and-spoke: a member connects only to its Border, and
a member MUST NOT accept inbound federation connections.

iN2N uses a **separate** Border listener (not the shared discrimination port of
{{discrimination}}). The transport preamble is shown in {{fig-in2n-preamble}}.

~~~
Border --> Member:  "IN2N1" (5 octets) || nonce (32 octets, random)
Member --> Border:  JSON-RPC  in2n/hello | in2n/enroll
   params: an ECDSA (P-256, SHA-256) signature over the nonce, proving
   the member holds its pinned self-signed key
   ... the standard NCFED framing/JSON-RPC channel then runs ...
~~~
{: #fig-in2n-preamble title="iN2N transport preamble"}

The trailing "1" in the "IN2N1" magic is a preamble version digit. The exact JSON
parameters and their encodings — PEM certificate, hexadecimal DER-encoded ECDSA
signature, and hexadecimal key fingerprint — are specified in {{method-ref}}.

Enrollment and pinning:

1. The Border issues a single-use enrollment token, conveyed to the member out of
   band (for example, at install time). The token has the form `in2n_<random>` with
   at least 128 bits of entropy; the Border stores only its SHA-256 and MAY set an
   expiry.

2. The member generates its own key pair at runtime: ECDSA {{RFC6090}} on NIST curve
   P-256 {{RFC5480}} with SHA-256 {{RFC6234}}, in a self-signed X.509 certificate
   {{RFC5280}}.

3. On first contact (`in2n/enroll`) the member presents the token and its
   certificate; the Border validates and spends the token and **pins** the member's
   key (TOFU). The pinned identity is the SHA-256 of the certificate's
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

4. On every subsequent connection (`in2n/hello`) the member signs the Border's
   32-octet nonce with the pinned key; the Border verifies the signature.

A Border routes a request to the member that owns the capability, selecting
deterministically (most-specific specialist first, then lexicographically by member
identity); if no active member covers the capability it returns NO_CAPABLE_MEMBER,
and a member asked to act beyond its advertised scope returns OUT_OF_SCOPE. Operator
removal of a member unpins its key; a member that fails pinned-key authentication more
than a configurable number of times is automatically quarantined — its key unpinned —
and must be re-enrolled by the operator to return. The security implications of this
automatic quarantine are discussed in {{seccons-tofu}}.

iN2N authenticates the member to the Border: the member proves possession of its
pinned key over the Border's nonce. It does **not** authenticate the Border to the
member. A member accepts any well-formed "IN2N1" preamble and treats the channel as
trusted once the exchange completes, and the signed nonce proves key possession at
session start but is not bound to the transport. An optional TLS wrapper MAY encrypt
the iN2N socket for members reached across an untrusted network; it uses the member's
self-signed certificate {{RFC5280}} with certificate verification disabled, so it
supplies confidentiality only and establishes no channel binding. Consequently the
current design does not exclude an active on-path attacker between a member and its
Border; the intended hardening — mutual key pinning and channel binding — is described
in {{seccons-peer-auth}}.

# Operational Considerations {#operational}

* Lifecycle: severing is an operator action that revokes the local consent grant and
  drops the NCFED channel ({{trust-en2n}}); there is no dedicated peer-to-peer sever
  message. A severed peer is reachable again only after the operator re-consents.

* Hybrid runtime: a Border keeps a hot set of members connected and cold-starts
  others on demand, idling them out when quiet. Cold start appears on the wire only
  as connection-establishment latency.

* Least privilege: each member is provisioned with only the secrets its integration
  requires; compromise of one member does not expose another's credentials.

* A standalone claw is a degenerate risk of one that is its own Border; no protocol
  change is required for that case.

# Security Considerations {#seccons}

## Sharing a listening port with BGP {#seccons-port}

Because NCFED, BGP-4, and NCTUN share a TCP listening port ({{discrimination}}), the
NCFED discrimination and handshake parsers are reachable by any host that can reach
the BGP port. Operators SHOULD protect the shared port with the same controls they
apply to BGP peers — for example, access-control lists restricting the permitted
source addresses and, where the deployment allows, the Generalized TTL Security
Mechanism {{RFC5082}}. Implementations MUST enforce the discrimination read timeouts
({{discrimination}}: 30 s for the first octet, 10 s for the magic) and close on any
malformed or unexpected preamble, to limit resource consumption by connections that
stall before discrimination.

## Peer authentication {#seccons-peer-auth}

NCFED does **not** cryptographically authenticate an eN2N peer. The AS/router-id in
the handshake ({{handshake}}) is a cleartext claim, and consent and per-peer grants
are keyed to that claimed identity. Any host that can reach the shared port and
complete the handshake can assert a claimed identity; the request/reply handshake
confirms only that both ends present matching identities, not that either end holds a
credential proving it. eN2N peer authenticity is therefore only as strong as (a) the
authenticity and confidentiality of the underlay the channel runs over
({{seccons-conf}}), and (b) the source-address controls on the shared port
({{seccons-port}}). An attacker who can bypass those controls and reach the port can
impersonate a peer whose AS/router-id it knows.

iN2N is stronger in one direction and weaker in the other: it authenticates the
member to the Border (proof of possession of the pinned key over the Border's nonce),
but it does not authenticate the Border to the member, and its optional TLS wrapper
disables certificate verification, so it provides no channel binding
({{trust-in2n}}). The signed nonce proves key possession at session start only; with
verification disabled, an active on-path attacker could relay it.

This is a deliberate, documented limitation of this Experimental protocol, consistent
with its small-set-of-known-peers applicability ({{applicability}}). A future revision
is expected to add cryptographic peer authentication. Candidate mechanisms include
mutually authenticated TLS with certificates ({{RFC8446}}, {{RFC5280}}); extending the
iN2N proof-of-possession and key-pinning model to eN2N so that both peers pin each
other's keys at consent and sign a session nonce (which would also supply channel
binding for both trust models); or an emerging agent-identity and naming layer such
as the Agent Name Service {{ANS}}. Until such a mechanism exists, deployments MUST NOT
rely on NCFED alone for peer authentication; eN2N peer identity rests on BGP-derived
operational identity confirmed out of band, strict default-deny per-peer authorization
({{seccons-deleg}}), the deterministic-initiator and mutual-consent rules of
{{trust-en2n}}, and the shared-port controls of {{seccons-port}}.

## Trust on first use {#seccons-tofu}

eN2N relies on out-of-band confirmation of a peer's AS/router-id before consent; iN2N
relies on TOFU pinning of a member's self-signed key at enrollment ({{trust}}). TOFU
is vulnerable to an active attacker present at enrollment time. Enrollment tokens
therefore MUST have at least 128 bits of entropy, MUST be single-use, SHOULD carry an
expiry, and SHOULD be delivered over a confidential out-of-band channel. To detect an
intercepted enrollment, the member SHOULD display the SHA-256 fingerprint of its
generated certificate out of band so the operator can confirm it matches the value the
Border pinned. If enrollment is suspected to have been intercepted, the operator
removes (unpins) the member and re-enrolls it with a fresh token; the compromised key
is thereby refused. This model is a deliberate instance of opportunistic security
{{RFC7435}}: it raises the bar against passive attackers and is appropriate for the
small-set-of-known-peers applicability ({{applicability}}), but it is not a substitute
for a PKI.

The automatic quarantine that unpins a member after repeated failed authentications
({{trust-in2n}}) is itself an availability hazard: an attacker who learns a member
identifier and can reach the Border's iN2N listener can submit repeated failing
authentications to drive that member over the quarantine threshold, unpinning it and
removing it from routing — a denial of service against a legitimate member. Operators
SHOULD restrict reachability of the iN2N listener to member hosts, and a future
revision SHOULD source-bind or rate-limit failed-authentication accounting rather than
counting unauthenticated attempts globally (see {{impl-status}}).

## Confidentiality and integrity {#seccons-conf}

NCFED runs in cleartext by default; it provides neither confidentiality nor
transport-layer integrity on its own. In the reference deployment it runs over
private, overlay, or tunneled transports between mutually known peers. For any path
that crosses an untrusted network, deployments SHOULD carry NCFED over an encrypted
underlay or tunnel — for example an encrypted data-plane tunnel, a VPN such as
WireGuard {{WIREGUARD}}, or a TLS {{RFC8446}} tunnel that terminates below NCFED.
NCFED does not itself perform a TLS handshake on the shared discrimination port: a
direct TLS ClientHello is not a recognized discriminator value and is closed
({{discrimination}}). The optional iN2N TLS wrapper ({{trust-in2n}}) uses the member's
self-signed certificate {{RFC5280}} with certificate verification disabled: it
supplies encryption only, establishes no channel binding, and MUST NOT be relied upon
for peer authentication ({{seccons-peer-auth}}).

## Agent-delegation hazards {#seccons-deleg}

`n2n/tools/call` and task delegation cause actions to be taken on real infrastructure
at the request of a remote AI agent. Deployments:

* MUST authorize remote invocation per peer (default-deny; explicit grants), and
  SHOULD constrain grants with approval requirements, budgets, and rate limits;
* MUST treat content returned across the federation boundary (tool results, task
  output) as untrusted input to the local agent, which can carry prompt-injection
  payloads; such content SHOULD NOT be interpreted as instructions;
* SHOULD log every federated invocation at the Border for audit, and MAY gate
  execution behind a production-mode guardrail that inspects model input/output;
* SHOULD bound delegation depth to prevent loops when federated agents can themselves
  re-delegate. This document does not define a delegation-depth or hop-count field;
  implementations that permit transitive delegation SHOULD add and enforce one, and a
  future revision is expected to carry a decrementing hop count in the tool and task
  method families ({{impl-status}}).

Because the task-retrieval methods are keyed by task identifier alone
({{semantics}}), a task identifier is a bearer capability: a peer that learns another
peer's task identifier could read or cancel that task. Implementations SHOULD generate
unguessable task identifiers, and a future revision SHOULD bind a task to the
requesting peer and authorize retrieval accordingly.

## Denial of service {#seccons-dos}

A payload is capped at 64 KiB per frame ({{framing}}) and an oversize Length MUST
cause a close. However, a message MAY be reassembled from an unbounded number of
CONTINUATION frames; a receiver SHOULD impose an upper bound on the total reassembled
message size and on the memory retained for in-progress reassembly, and close a
channel that exceeds it. The reference implementation does not currently enforce such
an aggregate bound ({{impl-status}}); a future revision is expected to define one
together with a reassembly timeout. The heartbeat mechanism ({{heartbeat}}) and
cold-start ({{operational}}) can be abused as resource-exhaustion vectors; operators
SHOULD apply the per-peer rate/approval controls above and the port protections of
{{seccons-port}}.

## Capability-card privacy {#seccons-priv}

A capability card ({{cards}}) enumerates the advertiser's exposed skills, MCP servers,
security posture, and reasoning-model family. This is attack-surface metadata. An
endpoint MUST advertise only the subset a peer is authorized to see and MUST NOT
include secrets or per-member topology; operators SHOULD treat card contents as
sensitive, especially over cleartext transport ({{seccons-conf}}). A future revision
may define a minimized or integrity-protected card.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This document requests that IANA register the following service name in the Service
Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry {{RFC6335}}:

* Service Name: `ncfed`
* Transport Protocol: TCP
* Description: NetClaw-to-NetClaw Federation Protocol
* Assignee: John Capobianco <ptcapo@gmail.com>
* Contact: John Capobianco <ptcapo@gmail.com>
* Reference: This document
* Port Number: none requested. NCFED does not define a fixed well-known port; a
  deployment multiplexes NCFED onto an operator-configured port (in the reference
  deployment, the BGP/mesh port), discriminated as in {{discrimination}}.
* Assignment Notes: NCFED operates over unicast TCP only; it does not use UDP,
  broadcast, multicast, or anycast.

This document does **not** request a registry for the first-octet discrimination
tags ("NCFED", "NCTUN"); they are documented here for reference. Should third-party
extensions of the tag space emerge, a future document may define such a registry
(e.g., under a Specification Required or Expert Review policy {{RFC8126}}).

# Prior Art and Design Rationale

NCFED's first-octet discrimination is analogous in spirit to, but distinct from, TLS
ALPN {{RFC7301}}, which negotiates the application protocol within the TLS
handshake; NCFED discriminates in cleartext at the head of the TCP stream so that it
can co-tenant with BGP without terminating TLS. Its length-prefixed, flag-bearing
framing and post-handshake message model are in the lineage of WebSocket {{RFC6455}}.
Its use of AS/router-id as agent identity reuses the operational identity model of
BGP-4 {{RFC4271}}, which fits the network-engineering deployment.

NCFED is closest, among current IETF work, to
{{YAN-A2A}} ("Applicability of A2A Protocol for Network Management Agents"). That
work applies A2A to network management within a **single administrative domain**,
between a controller agent and device agents, over mutually authenticated TLS, and
does not address federation of independently operated agents. NCFED is
complementary: it federates agents across **different** operators (eN2N, keyed by
AS/router-id and mutual consent) and coordinates one operator's agents in a
hub-and-spoke risk (iN2N, enrollment-token + TOFU), and it **carries** MCP and A2A
payloads rather than defining new agent-card or task semantics of its own. A
one-sentence differentiation: *NCFED is a cross-operator federation, identity, and
transport layer — multiplexed with BGP — that transports A2A/MCP between
independently operated network agents.*

Hub-and-spoke (rather than a full mesh) was chosen for iN2N so that a single Border
provides one audit, policy, and routing boundary and one external identity for a
risk; members never accept inbound connections, which minimizes their attack
surface.

# Implementation Status {#impl-status}
{:removeinrfc="true"}

This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by
this specification at the time of posting, per {{?RFC7942}}. It is to be removed
before publication as an RFC.

**Implementation:** the open-source NetClaw project (`automateyournetwork/netclaw`).
NCFED (eN2N and iN2N) is deployed and in daily use across a live three-operator mesh
(AS 65001, AS 65007, AS 65099) and within one operator's risk (a Border and its
member claws). Coverage: protocol discrimination, the 13-octet handshake, the frame
format and heartbeat, JSON-RPC method families, in-band negotiation, and both trust
models are all implemented and interoperating.

**Interoperability evidence (packet capture):** a 37.5-second capture of a live NCFED
channel between johns-risk (AS 65001) and Nick (AS 65007) was taken at the initiator
(`ncfed-johns-risk-nick-20260714.pcap` in the project repository) while three
application-level round-trips were exercised:

* One long-lived TCP conversation, `192.168.2.61:45722` <-> `13.58.157.220:10416`
  (the initiator to the peer's tunnel edge); 24 packets, 3141 octets, near-symmetric
  (13 in / 1567 octets, 11 out / 1574 octets).
* TCP health: only ACK and PSH-ACK segments in-window (no SYN/FIN/RST — a persistent,
  already-established control channel), with zero retransmissions and zero duplicate
  ACKs.
* Payload segmentation: 12 zero-length (pure-ACK) segments plus data segments of 5,
  75, 110, 127, 153, 274, and 352 octets — small, bursty, and request/response-shaped,
  consistent with a control/chat protocol rather than bulk transfer.

**Capture methodology and limitations (important, honest scope):** this capture was
taken on the wire *inside the peer's TLS-terminated tunnel transport* (the deployment
reaches the remote AS over a tunnel provider). The captured payload octets are
therefore **ciphertext**: the capture is accurate, first-hand evidence of the NCFED
**channel** — real endpoints, a persistent established session, healthy TCP, and a
request/response traffic shape between two independently operated ASes — but it does
**not** expose decrypted NCFED frames, so the segment sizes above are TLS-record
sizes carrying NCFED, not raw NCFED frame boundaries. A plaintext capture of the NCFED
frames themselves requires capturing at the application layer (e.g., on loopback,
before the tunnel) or on an underlay where the operator holds the keys (e.g.,
WireGuard); such a capture is future work and is the recommended way to demonstrate
the frame-level behavior specified in {{framing}} and {{handshake}} directly.

**Known limitations recorded for a future revision.** In preparing this document, the
running code and this description were reconciled against the source. The following
are known gaps in the current implementation. They are documented here honestly and
targeted for a future NCFED revision, rather than changed in the frozen wire this
`-00` describes:

* eN2N performs no cryptographic peer authentication; iN2N does not authenticate the
  Border to the member, and its optional TLS wrapper disables certificate
  verification (no channel binding). See {{seccons-peer-auth}}.
* Message reassembly enforces the 64 KiB per-frame cap but no aggregate size bound or
  reassembly timeout. See {{seccons-dos}}.
* Repeated failed iN2N authentication auto-quarantines a member, which an attacker who
  knows a member identifier can abuse as a denial of service. See {{seccons-tofu}}.
* The tool and task method families carry no delegation hop count, and task-retrieval
  methods do not verify caller ownership. See {{seccons-deleg}}.
* MEMBER_ID_TAKEN (-32022) is defined but not yet emitted; the condition is currently
  reported as ENROLL_TOKEN_INVALID (-32021). See {{errors}}.
* In-band "version negotiation" is feature advertisement with graceful degradation,
  not selection of a common protocol version. See {{negotiation}}.

This evidence is provided to document running code and operational reality; it is not
a normative part of the protocol.

# JSON-RPC Method Reference {#method-ref}

This appendix specifies the parameter and result objects for each NCFED method, as
implemented in the reference implementation ({{impl-status}}). All objects are JSON
{{RFC8259}}; unless stated otherwise, an unrecognized member is ignored. Encodings: a
binary signature is a lowercase hexadecimal string of a DER-encoded ECDSA signature
{{RFC6090}} over the relevant nonce; a certificate is PEM-encoded {{RFC5280}}; a key
fingerprint is the lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 {{RFC6234}} of the certificate's
SubjectPublicKeyInfo {{RFC5480}}. Examples are illustrative.

## eN2N methods

`n2n/hello` — request `params` and `result` share the descriptor shape:

~~~
params: {
  "identity": "as65001-4.4.4.4",
  "display_name": "johns-risk",
  "versions": ["1.0"],
  "capabilities": {
    "proto_version": "053",
    "features": ["async_tasks", "endpoint_reannounce", "negotiate"],
    "agent_invoke": "session-id",
    "reply_shapes": ["finalAssistantVisibleText", "payloads"]
  }
}
result: {
  "display_name": "nick",
  "capabilities": { ...same shape as params.capabilities... }
}
~~~

`n2n/tools/call` — the `tool` member MUST have the form `server_id/tool_name`;
otherwise the callee returns JSON-RPC error -32602 (invalid params). The `result` is
the MCP {{MCP}} tool-result object from the named server. Authorization failures use
the codes of {{errors}}.

~~~
params: { "tool":       "<server_id>/<tool_name>",
          "arguments":  { ...tool-specific JSON... },
          "request_id": "as65001-4.4.4.4:42" }
~~~

`n2n/tasks/submit` — A2A-style {{A2A}} delegation:

~~~
params: { "skill":      "<skill-name>",
          "input_text": "<free text passed to the skill>",
          "request_id": "as65001-4.4.4.4:43" }
result: { "task_id": "<opaque string>", "state": "submitted" }
~~~

`n2n/tasks/status`, `n2n/tasks/result`, `n2n/tasks/cancel` — each takes
`params: { "task_id": "<opaque string>" }` and returns:

~~~
status: {
  "task_id": "...", "target": "<skill-name>",
  "state": "submitted|working|completed|failed|cancelled|unknown",
  "progress": "<string or null>"
}
result: {
  "task_id": "...", "state": "...", "tokens_used": <number>,
  "output_text": "<present when completed>",
  "error": "<present when failed>"
}
cancel: { "task_id": "...", "cancelled": <boolean> }
~~~

`n2n/inventory`, `n2n/inventory_get` — push and pull of the capability card
({{cards}}).

## iN2N methods

Each iN2N method is sent by the member after receiving the Border's "IN2N1" preamble
and 32-octet nonce ({{trust-in2n}}); the `signature` proves possession of the
member's pinned key over that nonce.

`in2n/enroll` — first contact. On success the Border spends the token and pins the
certificate's SubjectPublicKeyInfo. Errors: NOT_A_BORDER (-32024); MEMBER_NOT_TRUSTED
(-32023) on possession failure; ENROLL_TOKEN_INVALID (-32021) for a spent or expired
token, or a member identifier already pinned to another key ({{errors}}).

~~~
params: { "token":             "in2n_<url-safe random>",
          "member_id":         "<risk-local id>",
          "cert_pem":          "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ...",
          "signature":         "<hex DER ECDSA over the nonce>",
          "scope":             "<optional capability scope>",
          "runtime_kind":      "process",
          "display_name":      "<optional>",
          "transport_binding": "distributed" }
~~~

`in2n/hello` — reconnect. A mismatched fingerprint or signature returns
MEMBER_NOT_TRUSTED (-32023) and counts toward auto-quarantine ({{seccons-tofu}}).

~~~
params: { "member_id":       "<risk-local id>",
          "key_fingerprint": "<hex SHA-256 of SubjectPublicKeyInfo>",
          "signature":       "<hex DER ECDSA over the nonce>" }
result: { "risk": "<risk name>", "trusted": true,
          "member_state": "active" }
~~~

# NCFED Hardening Backlog — seed for a future spec (060+) and draft `-01`

This file records the **code / protocol changes** deliberately deferred while
authoring `draft-capobianco-ncfed-00`. The `-00` draft keeps the FREEZE (FR-024): it
describes the running wire exactly and honestly, including its limitations. None of
the items below are blockers for an **Experimental** submission — they are the
roadmap for the *next* revision (a hardening spec, then draft `-01`).

Each item lists: the gap, where it lives in the code, the proposed fix, and the draft
section that already documents it honestly today.

Source of truth verified 2026-07-14 against `mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/bgp/` and
`bgp/federation/*`.

---

## Tier 1 — cheap, high-value, unambiguous (recommended first)

### H1. Bounded message reassembly (DoS)
- **Gap:** the 64 KiB per-frame cap is enforced, but a message reassembled from many
  CONTINUATION frames grows an unbounded buffer.
- **Code:** `bgp/federation/channel.py` `_read_loop` — `self._recv_buf += chunk` with
  no aggregate limit or timeout.
- **Fix:** add an aggregate reassembled-size cap and a reassembly timeout; close the
  channel on exceed. Define the concrete bound in the spec.
- **Draft today:** §Denial of service (`seccons-dos`) + Implementation Status.

### H2. Delegation hop count (loop prevention)
- **Gap:** no hop-count/TTL in the wire; transitive delegation loops rely on each
  implementation adding its own guard.
- **Code:** `bgp/federation/invocation.py` `handle_tools_call` / `handle_task_submit`
  (no hop field in params).
- **Fix:** add a decrementing integer (e.g. `ncfed_hop_count`) to the tool + task
  method families; MUST decrement and reject at zero.
- **Draft today:** §Agent-delegation hazards (`seccons-deleg`).

### H3. Task ownership / authorization on retrieval
- **Gap:** `n2n/tasks/status|result|cancel` are keyed by `task_id` alone; any peer
  with the id can read/cancel. Task id is effectively a bearer token.
- **Code:** `bgp/federation/tasks.py` `status`/`result`/`cancel` — lookup by
  `task_id`, no caller check.
- **Fix:** bind a task to the submitting `peer_identity`; authorize retrieval against
  it. Keep task ids unguessable regardless.
- **Draft today:** §Semantic Payload (task note) + `seccons-deleg`.

### H4. Quarantine-as-DoS mitigation
- **STATUS: RESOLVED** — feature 060 / draft -01. Per-source failed-auth accounting (`risk.note_source_failure`); foreign-source failures rate-limited, never count toward a member's quarantine.
- **Gap:** repeated *unauthenticated* `in2n/hello` attempts with a known `member_id`
  drive `auth_failures` over the threshold, unpinning a legitimate member.
- **Code:** `bgp/federation/risk.py` `record_auth_failure` (global per-member count);
  triggered from `service.py` `_in2n_on_hello`.
- **Fix:** source-bind / rate-limit failed-auth accounting; do not let unauthenticated
  attempts alone unpin a member. Restrict iN2N listener reachability (deployment).
- **Draft today:** §Trust on first use (`seccons-tofu`) + Implementation Status.

### H5. Emit MEMBER_ID_TAKEN (-32022)
- **Gap:** `-32022` is defined but never reaches the wire; a member-id collision is
  reported as `-32021` (ENROLL_TOKEN_INVALID).
- **Code:** `service.py` `_in2n_on_enroll` maps any non-"TRUSTED" `ValueError` to
  `-32021`; `risk.py` `consume_token` raises `ValueError("IN2N_ERR_MEMBER_ID_TAKEN")`.
- **Fix:** map the member-id-taken `ValueError` to `-32022`.
- **Draft today:** §Error codes (`errors`) + Implementation Status.

### H6. Capability-card minimization / integrity
- **Gap:** cards disclose skills, MCP servers, posture, model family (attack-surface
  metadata) over cleartext.
- **Code:** `bgp/federation/inventory.py`, `posture.py`.
- **Fix:** per-peer minimized card; optional integrity protection. (Partly present via
  per-peer authz — tighten and document the minimization contract.)
- **Draft today:** §Capability-card privacy (`seccons-priv`).

## Tier 2 — real design work (the two "Critical" review findings)

### H7. eN2N cryptographic peer authentication  *(headline gap)*
- **STATUS: RESOLVED** — feature 060 / draft -01 §Channel Security. Encrypted (TLS 1.3) channel + application-layer proof-of-possession (signed nonce) with domain-verified (ACME) or pinned (TOFU) trust models + tier-0/tier-1 admission. Also closed the forged-handshake spoof reported by Josh/TunnelMind.
- **Gap:** the 13-octet handshake identity (AS/router-id) is a cleartext claim; no
  cryptographic proof. Consent/grants key off the claim.
- **Code:** `service.py` `accept_channel` / `open_channel` (identity from handshake,
  no signature); `manager.py` consent keyed by identity string.
- **Proposed fix (reuse what already works):** extend the **iN2N** proof-of-possession
  pattern to eN2N — at consent, operators also exchange a **key fingerprint**; each
  side pins the other's key; the handshake / `n2n/hello` carries a **signed nonce**.
  One mechanism, consistent across eN2N/iN2N, no new PKI. Decision (2026-07-14): do
  **not** invent PKI; acknowledge cert/mutual-TLS or the Agent Name Service (ANS,
  `draft-narajala-ans`) as alternatives in the draft; ship `-00` with BGP identity +
  OOB confirmation + strict default-deny consent as the interim model.
- **Draft today:** §Peer authentication (`seccons-peer-auth`) — disclosed + forward
  path named.

### H8. iN2N Border-to-member authentication + channel binding
- **STATUS: RESOLVED** — feature 060 / draft -01 §iN2N. Border-as-CA hub attestation: member verifies the Border's CA-signed hub cert chains to its enrolled anchor + signed the member's nonce. Mutual auth. (tls-server-end-point channel binding now wired into the primary channel path — draft §6.3.)
- **Gap:** member authenticates to Border, but Border is **not** authenticated to the
  member; optional TLS uses `CERT_NONE` (no channel binding). MITM can relay the
  nonce / interpose post-auth.
- **Code:** `service.py` iN2N accept path (member trusts any `IN2N1` preamble);
  `internal_channel.py` / TLS context with verification disabled.
- **Proposed fix:** member also pins the **Border's** key (mutual TOFU); enable real
  cert verification against pinned keys; bind the signed nonce to the session.
  Naturally solved together with H7.
- **Draft today:** §Peer authentication (`seccons-peer-auth`) + §iN2N.

## Documentation-only (already handled in `-00`, no code change)

- **D1. TLS vs shared port:** a TLS ClientHello (0x16) is not a discriminator value and
  is closed; encryption comes from an underlay/tunnel or the separate iN2N listener,
  not inline TLS on the shared port. → §Discrimination, §Confidentiality.
- **D2. Version negotiation is feature-advertisement + graceful degrade,** not version
  selection. A real negotiation scheme (common-version selection, required-feature
  failure) is future work. → §Negotiation.

## Suggested sequencing (per 2026-07-14 discussion)

1. Ship `draft-capobianco-ncfed-00` (this honest Experimental draft) — optional now.
2. New spec `060-ncfed-hardening`: Tier 1 (H1–H6) + the H7/H8 mutual-pin design.
3. Implement on the frozen base; **test with a real claw** + the live 3-node mesh.
4. Coordinate the mesh: Byrn (AS 65099) & Nick (AS 65007) `git pull`, re-exchange key
   fingerprints, re-consent / re-enroll (pins change). Ship an upgrade note.
5. Rewrite the draft to describe the hardened wire → `draft-capobianco-ncfed-01`.

## `-02` seed — wire-hardening deltas from spec 063 (2026-07-17)

Surfaced by the live two-operator packet capture (Nicholas AS 65007 ↔ Byrn AS 65099,
`captures/n2n-encrypted-20260717.pcap`), which confirmed the `-01` channel is fully
TLS-encrypted with zero JSON-RPC leakage and flagged four follow-ups. Spec 063 lands
three of the four in code (endpoint persistence, PQ posture, metadata seam);
mesh-layer TLS is a deferred, coordinated flag-day (below). The `-01` markdown +
rendered artifacts stay FROZEN and coherent; fold the text below when cutting `-02`.

### H9. Endpoint persistence — *STATUS: RESOLVED (spec 063 / US1)*
- **Was:** `/n2n/connect` + `open_channel` dialed a peer's fresh address but never
  persisted `endpoint_host/port`, so after a restart the reconnect supervisor used the
  STALE stored endpoint → connection-refused → manual re-dial on every ngrok rotation.
- **Fix (shipped):** `open_channel` persists the reached endpoint via `upsert_peer`
  **only on a successful, authenticated dial** (never on the failure path);
  `upsert_peer` centralizes the `endpoint_updated_at` freshness bump; the supervisor
  already reads these. Operational behavior; not a wire-format change.
- **Draft:** operational note only (§Operational Considerations) — no normative change.

### H10. Observable metadata residuals — *document in `-02` (accepted by design)*
- **Reality:** two identity signals remain visible to a passive on-path observer after
  `-01`'s TLS: (a) the cleartext 13-octet NCFED preamble carries AS + router-id (kept
  cleartext so the shared port can discriminate NCFED from BGP/NCTUN *before* TLS —
  structural, cannot move inside TLS without breaking discrimination, §discrimination);
  (b) the TLS SNI carries the claw domain in domain-verified mode (ECH not yet
  available on the reference stack). Together they let an observer enumerate who
  federates with whom.
- **Shipped (063/US3):** an ECH-ready no-op seam in the dialer TLS context that
  activates automatically once `ssl` exposes ECH; posture (`/n2n/posture`) now reports
  both residuals so operators see the exposure rather than assume it away.
- **Ready-to-fold `-02` prose (new §seccons subsection "Observable metadata"):**
  > Even with the channel encrypted ({{seccons-conf}}), a passive on-path observer can
  > still learn *who federates with whom* from two signals that NCFED does not conceal.
  > First, the discrimination preamble ({{discrimination}}) carries the initiator's AS
  > and router-id in the clear; this is structural — the shared port MUST discriminate
  > NCFED before any TLS ClientHello — and cannot be moved inside TLS without a
  > dedicated port. Second, in the domain-verified trust model ({{channel-sec-models}})
  > the TLS SNI carries the acceptor's claw domain. Implementations SHOULD support
  > Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) to conceal the SNI where both the stack and the
  > deployment allow it, and operators who require unlinkability SHOULD prefer the
  > pinned trust model (no domain in SNI) or a dedicated non-shared port. These residual
  > exposures are accepted by design and are surfaced in the operator posture view.

### H11. Post-quantum key-exchange posture — *document in `-02`*
- **Reality:** the capture showed the initiator offering the X25519MLKEM768 hybrid but
  the peer negotiating classical X25519 — acceptance depends on *both* TLS stacks.
- **Shipped (063/US4):** `N2N_PQ_MODE` (opportunistic default) offers the hybrid where
  the stack supports it and accepts classical fallback; `require` hard-refuses classical
  on a capable stack and **fails fast at startup** on a stack that cannot do PQ at all
  (never silently refusing every peer); per-channel `tls_version`/`cipher`/`kex_group`
  + `pq: available|unavailable` are surfaced honestly (`kex_group` is unreadable, hence
  `null`, on OpenSSL < 3.5 / Python < 3.13).
- **Ready-to-fold `-02` prose (add to §seccons-conf):**
  > NCFED inherits its key exchange from TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}}. Implementations SHOULD
  > offer a post-quantum hybrid group (e.g. X25519MLKEM768) ahead of classical curves;
  > because a hybrid is negotiated only when both peers' TLS stacks support it, NCFED
  > treats PQ as opportunistic by default and MAY be configured to require it (refusing
  > a classical negotiation), noting that requiring PQ on a stack that cannot offer it
  > MUST fail loudly at configuration time rather than silently refusing all peers. The
  > negotiated group SHOULD be visible in the operator posture view so an operator can
  > tell whether a given channel obtained PQ or classical key exchange.

### H12. Mesh-layer confidentiality — *DEFERRED: coordinated flag-day (spec 063/US2)*
- **Reality:** the BGP mesh/keepalive session that co-tenants the shared port
  (§discrimination) is still cleartext BGP; on the WAN leg it currently rides inside the
  transport's TLS (ngrok), which is incidental, not guaranteed. Routing/identity
  metadata on that leg is observable on an untrusted path.
- **Plan (not yet shipped):** bring the mesh session under NCFED's own STARTTLS-style
  in-protocol TLS + auth (the same `tls.upgrade_to_tls` primitive `-01`/060 already
  use), gated by `N2N_CERT_MODE`, upgraded *after* the BGP OPEN identify. Deferred from
  063 implementation because it modifies the BGP routing core (`agent.py` collision /
  OPEN-replay path + `session.py`), requires two-node validation against the live FRR/
  mesh FSM, and only pays off in a coordinated multi-peer rollout — a supervised flag-day
  like the 060 cutover, not an unsupervised change.
- **Draft:** until shipped, `-02` MUST describe the mesh trust boundary honestly as
  "relies on the transport's encryption on untrusted legs; bringing the mesh session
  under NCFED's own TLS is defined but optional/staged" — do NOT claim it as done.

### Cutting `-02` (supervised)
Recommended to cut the formal `-02` **once H12/mesh-TLS lands**, so the revision tells a
complete wire-hardening story rather than documenting a half-shipped feature. Steps
mirror `-01`: bump `docname` to `draft-capobianco-ncfed-02`, fold in the H10/H11 prose
(and H12 once shipped), re-render via `kdrfc`, re-run `idnits`, and update `rendered/`.
H9 is operational-only (no draft change).
